# WeatherServant
Create an application that will automatically send desired weather products to the user at regular intervals before a flight

## Overview
There are a variety of websites and apps prodcued by governmental and private organizations that provide a valuable database of accurate weather data. Weather briefings are great tools for long cross-country flights where the pilot bdugets time to trip planning. But, pilots never actually use the service when they need it most. 

Pilots often forego the weather briefing when they are are doing pattern work or flying in their local area, which can be dangerous because these types of flights are some of the most common. Some pilots sometimes make a go/no-go descision after quickly looking at the airports ATIS or one-minute-weather since the time cost of seraching for a complete weather picture seemingly outweighs the safety benefits for such short flights. Therefore, the goal of the project is to reduce the burden of getting a complete weather picture to help improve flight safety.

To accomplish this, I want to create a simple application, called WeatherServant, that automatically sends key weather products to the pilot before each flight. The app will allow the user to select a set of desired weather products (charts, maps, data...) and input when the flight will take place. Then, it will send an email to the pilot containing the most up-to-date weather before his flight. By making the weather data easily retrieveable and shareable, the pilot woud have a full weather picture at a glance, making for a safer flight.
